# Async-TCP

Async-TCP is a streamlined C++ library that offers genuine, non-blocking network communication tailored for RP2040
series boards with Arduino Pico core.

Rather than managing threads, blocking calls, or low-level callbacks, you can organise your code around straightforward,
event-driven handlers.

Behind the scenes, the library effectively connects system-level events from the Pico SDK and LwIP to safe and
responsive C++ callbacks that run where they shouldâ€”on the appropriate core in the defined execution context.

This design enables concurrency without unexpected side effects and makes asynchronous network code easy to comprehend
and expand.
