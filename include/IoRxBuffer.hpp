     * Ownership and lifetime:
     * - IoRxBuffer assumes ownership of the head of the pbuf chain it receives
     *   from lwIP and frees segments as they are fully consumed.
     * - peekBuffer() returns a pointer valid until the next peekConsume() or
     *   reset(); it may be null if no data is available.
     *
     * Consumption model:
     * - peekAvailable() reports bytes remaining in the current pbuf segment
     *   (not the entire chain).
     * - peekConsume(n) advances the cursor across segments, freeing exhausted
     *   pbufs and updating the TCP receive window via tcp_recved() with the
     *   exact consumed count.
     *
     * Thread-safety and context:
     * - Not thread-safe. Call only from the networking coreâ€™s async context
     *   (e.g., inside PerpetualBridge/EphemeralBridge on that core) or from
     *   lwIP callbacks. Do not call from ISRs or other cores.
